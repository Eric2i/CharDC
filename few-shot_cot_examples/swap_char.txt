Example Task: Swap "l" and "b" in "alphabet". 

Let's think step by step:

- "alphabet" contains the following list of letters: ["a", "l", "p", "h", "a", "b", "e", "t"].
- the goal of this task is to swap "l" and "b", which leads to a new modified list of letters: ["a", "b", "p", "h", "a", "l", "e", "t"].
- the final result is the concatenation of the new list of letters: "abphalet"

Answer: "abphalet"
