Example Task: Insert an "e" after every "a" in "alphabet". 

Let's think step by step:

- "alphabet" contains the following list of letters: ["a", "l", "p", "h", "a", "b", "e", "t"].
- the goal of this task is to add letter "e" after every "a", which leads to a new modified list of letters: ["a", "e", "l", "p", "h", "a", "e", "b", "e", "t"].
- the final result is the concatenation of the new list of letters: "aelphaebet"

Answer: "aelphaebet"
